# Polynomials

A simple Web service that differentiates polynomial expressions
implemented as a minimal Ruby on Rails API application.

Setup:

    $ bundle install

In order to run the tests:

    $ bundle exec rspec spec

## TODO

- [ ] More tests for the `Polynomial` class - likely to be
missing a few edge cases
- [ ] More requests specs for `PolynomialsController` to cover
invalid inputs and other errors
